I felt like making an implementation of Windows solitaire in JS
to test my coding ability as a fun challenge.

Requirements:

- Modern-ish web browser
- Web browser with font that supports cards in unicode

Only tested on Mac yosemite so the card fonts might look horribly 
messed up on other systems.

All game logic/algorithms and UI code written by me, except the 
sugar/jquery/underscore JS libraries I used for convenience.

I license this under BSD. Do whatever you want with this code, but 
say you got it from me.
